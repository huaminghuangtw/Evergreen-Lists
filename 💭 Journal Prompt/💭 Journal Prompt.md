Peace of mind is the arguments you don't engage. Avoid the bad to protect the good.‚Äù ‚Äî James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/3-2-1/march-27-2025)

[^3]: ‚ÄúA lion is fully capable of capturing, killing, and eating a field mouse. But it turns out that the energy required to do so exceeds the caloric content of the mouse itself. So a lion that spent its day hunting and eating field mice would slowly starve to death. A lion can‚Äôt live on field mice. A lion needs antelope. Antelope are big animals. They take more speed and strength to capture and kill, and once killed, they provide a feast for the lion and her pride. A lion can live a long and happy life on a diet of antelope. The distinction is important. Are you spending all your time and exhausting all your energy catching field mice? In the short term it might give you a nice, rewarding feeling. But in the long run you‚Äôre going to die.‚Äù ‚Äî _Buck Up, Suck Up ‚Ä¶ and Come Back When You Foul Up: 12 Winning Secrets from the War Room_

Success, popularity, and power can indeed present a great temptation, but their seductive quality often comes from the way they are part of the much larger temptation to self-rejection. When we have come to believe in the voices that call us worthless and unlovable, then success, popularity, and power are easily perceived as attractive solutions. The real trap, however, is self-rejection. As soon as someone accuses me or criticizes me, as soon as I am rejected, left alone, or abandoned, I find myself thinking, ‚ÄùWell, that proves once again that I am a nobody.‚Äú ... [My dark side says,] I am no good... I deserve to be pushed aside, forgotten, rejected, and abandoned. Self-rejection is the greatest enemy of the spiritual life because it contradicts the sacred voice that calls us the ‚ÄùBeloved.‚Äú Being the Beloved constitutes the core truth of our existence.‚Äù ‚Äî Henri J.M.
