# Evergreen Lists

## About

This repository features a collection of [listicles](https://huami.ng/lists) I’ve curated over time. They are insights, tips, and ideas too short to be their own [notes](https://huami.ng/notes) or [essays](https://huami.ng/writing).

## How I Built This System

I use [ Apple Reminders](https://support.apple.com/en-au/guide/reminders/welcome/mac) not only for _task management_, but also for _note-taking_. Its support for **notes**, **tags**, **URLs**, and **subtasks** makes it a powerful tool for organizing knowledge.

Whenever I come across something interesting, I add it to the relevant Reminder list. Every month, I use [ Apple Shortcuts](https://shortcutomation.com/share-evergreen-lists/) to export these items into three formats—**[Google Sheets](https://shortcutomation.com/evergreen-list-to-google-sheets/)**, **[JSON](https://shortcutomation.com/evergreen-list-to-json/)**, and **[Markdown](https://shortcutomation.com/evergreen-list-to-markdown/)**. You can find all of them in this repo.

## Tools

Inspired by the concepts of [incremental learning](https://www.google.com/search?q=incremental+learning) and [microlearning](https://www.google.com/search?q=microlearning), I use these tools to regularly pull up and review these “Reminders”:

### Obsidian Callout

On desktop, I made an [Obsidian Callout](https://help.obsidian.md/callouts) with the [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) plugin. It shows a random item from the [evergreen lists](https://huami.ng/lists). For details, see the [full code snippet](https://github.com/huaminghuangtw/Second-Brain/blob/main/Homepage.md#-evergreen-lists).

### Apple Shortcuts

On mobile, I use  Apple Shortcuts to implement a flashcard system. It incorporates the [spaced repetition](https://www.google.com/search?q=spaced+repetition) and [active recall](https://www.google.com/search?q=active+recall) techniques. Try [this shortcut](https://shortcutomation.com/evergreen-lists/) to see how it works.
