                    "notes": "1. Identify the coolest part of your home. In the evening, find a window in a shaded area or on the lower floor where the air is cooler. If possible, use a thermometer to check which part of your home has the lowest temperature.\n2. Create cross-ventilation. Open windows on opposite sides of the house to encourage airflow. If you have multiple floors, open windows upstairs and downstairs to enhance the chimney effect.\n3. Wait for the right temperature. Once the outdoor temperature drops below the indoor temperature, it’s time to bring in cool air.\n4. Use a fan strategically. Place a powerful fan near the hottest window and direct it outward to push warm air out. This will draw in cooler air through the other windows.\n5. Seal the cool air inside. In the morning, before the outdoor temperature rises, close all windows and blinds to trap the cool air. Consider using blackout curtains to reduce heat gain throughout the day.",

When you place a wooden spoon over a pot of boiling liquid, any bubbles that touch it immediately burst. This action creates a small bubble-free area near the center of the pot, which allows other bubbles to move toward it and burst as well. Because these bubbles pop before they can rise to the edge of the pot, this cycle keeps the bubbling mass below the pot’s rim, effectively preventing boil-overs.\n2.
