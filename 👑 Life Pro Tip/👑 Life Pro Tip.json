When you place a wooden spoon over a pot of boiling liquid, any bubbles that touch it immediately burst. This action creates a small bubble-free area near the center of the pot, which allows other bubbles to move toward it and burst as well. Because these bubbles pop before they can rise to the edge of the pot, this cycle keeps the bubbling mass below the pot’s rim, effectively preventing boil-overs.\n2.

Place the bowl in the microwave and heat on full power for 5 minutes, until the liquid starts boiling.\n3. Leave the microwave door closed for 3 minutes to trap the steam, which will loosen grime.\n4. Carefully open the door, using an oven mitt/glove to remove the hot bowl.\n5. Use a sponge or towel to wipe down the microwave's interior, starting from the top and moving down to the sides and door. For tough spots, scrub gently as needed.\n6. Wipe the turntable with the sponge/towel, then dry it with a clean cloth. Your microwave is now clean!\n7. (Optional) Use any leftover white vinegar to remove grease from the _hob_, _work surfaces_, and _cupboards_—white vinegar is a powerful degreaser, _especially when warm_. It's also versatile for cleaning carpets, clearing drains, washing windows, freshening bathrooms, and more!",
