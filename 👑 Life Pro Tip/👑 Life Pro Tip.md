# 💡 On “Life Wisdom/Lesson”

* If it’s raining on a warm summer evening, go outside and dance in it.
* When you read something helpful, write to the author—a simple act that can yield meaningful results. By expressing your appreciation, you foster **real human connection**, reminding the creator that their work matters. This small gesture also helps **reinforce your learning**, as explaining why something resonated deepens understanding. Additionally, it can **open doors** to potential mentorships, collaborations, or friendships. Because most readers remain silent, your gratitude will be **rare—and memorable**. Whether it’s a bestselling writer or a niche blogger, reaching out strengthens a culture of appreciation and may spark unexpected opportunities.
* Read [leaked emails](https://www.wikileaks.org) to learn [how business actually works](https://x.com/TechEmails).
* Learn one funny dance move.
* Whenever you hug someone, be the last to let go. Life is more fragile than you think.
* Call your parents via Zoom and record it. Ask them questions and have them recount / tell stories about their childhood, adventures, fears, dreams, and major life events. Essentially, record a podcast/video interview. Our time with them is finite, but we often fail to recognize it until it’s too late. You’ll be so glad you have this when they’re no longer here. These recordings will last forever, and it really beats just having old photos.
* Ask someone to do you a small favour, so that he or she can ask you to do a big one in the future.
* When you borrow a man’s car, always return it with a full tank of gas.
* Separate time for experiencing the present from time for reflecting on memories, and post on social media only when reviewing photos back home, as we remember life more effectively not by taking more pictures, but by revisiting (and deleting) them.
* [Each path is unique. Remind yourself of this by reading _memoirs_ and _biographies_. If you ever feel like you’re straying from the common route, these books will reassure you that you’re carving out your own distinct journey.](https://mariandrew.substack.com/p/100-things-i-know)
* When learning something new, spend five minutes teaching it to someone else. Notice where they get confused—these are the areas where you need to refine your own understanding.
* [When learning something new, spend 5 minutes trying to teach it to someone. Make a note of where the other person gets confused. You'll get an immediate sense for your level of understanding of the topic and where you need to dig in more.](https://www.sahilbloom.com/newsletter/the-most-powerful-asymmetries-in-life)

# 💡 On “Eating”

* [Most of the pleasure in a dessert comes in the first three bites. After that, you should stop eating it. As a reward, you can eat dessert more often because you don’t binge it.](https://perell.com/note/28-pieces-of-life-advice/)
* 在食物裡加入一小撮抗氧化物，首推藥草和香料，例如奧勒岡草 (Oregano) 或肉桂粉 (Cinnamon)，即可大幅提升餐點之抗氧化能力。
* 🥗 Shake your salad back and forth in its container before eating. This helps distribute the dressing evenly, so you use less while still getting great flavor in every bite.
* Before squeezing a lime (or any citrus), roll it firmly on the counter with your palm for a few seconds. This breaks down the internal membranes and releases more juice, so you get the most out of every fruit with less effort.
* [Take cucumbers on your hike, bike ride, or any strenuous activity! Packed with 96% water, they’re a refreshing, hydrating boost when you need it most.](https://mariandrew.substack.com/p/100-things-i-know)
* [How to attract the right people? Be unapologetically yourself. When you edit your personality, you attract relationships that need constant maintenance. Stop filtering who you are to be liked. The right ones will stick. The wrong ones will walk.](https://x.com/SahilBloom/status/1949818412898607405)

# 💡 On “Moving”

* Use garbage bags to pack and transport your hanging clothes. Leave the clothes on the hangers, open a garbage bag, and start to fill it with 8-15 hangers and clothing items, with the bottom of the garments going in first. Then, take the garbage bag ties and wrap them around the neck of the hangers. You can reuse these bags for actual trash later.
* Hire movers, but pack and drive yourself. All the work and pain are in loading and unloading the truck.
* Make your bed the last (or nearly last) item on the truck so it’s the first off when unloading. Set it up immediately after unloading because you’ll want to rest well after a long drive or day of moving.
* Don’t ask your friends to help you move. Instead, ask them to help you _after_ the move to place stuff around, install blinds on the windows, clean the floor, etc.
* Use bright-colored labels or stickers, or write on every box to indicate where they should go (kitchen, living room, bedroom, etc.)
* Get boxes with the same dimensions. The best are empty banana boxes from the local grocery store — they are sturdy, free, and stack well.
* Always pack one box with the absolute essential living items. After a day of moving, you’ll be exhausted and won’t want to dig through several boxes to find them. Pack just enough to last you the next day or two while you unpack everything else.

# 💡 On “Giving”

* [Giving makes people happy, so why not give gifts others can give?](https://sketchplanations.com/give-gifts-others-can-give)
* If you’re torn on what gift to send someone, send a book you love. Pair it with a handwritten note explaining why you chose it for them—the more personal and specific, the better. This thoughtful gesture conveys genuine care and has the potential to foster a deeper connection.
* Write on a Post-it® note affixed to a greeting card rather than on the greeting card itself, so the recipient can throw away the Post-it® and reuse your card. (Employ similar logic for any disposable/consumable item.)

# 💡 On “Miscellaneous”

* Library card + [Libby](https://libbyapp.com/) = read stuff and take advantage of all the resources that come with it (e.g., e-books, movies, music, etc.) for FREE, without ever leaving the house! You can even share library cards with friends/family on Libby.
* If you believe the police might want your iPhone for evidence during a traffic stop, quickly activate the emergency screen by pressing and holding the **side button** and **volume up/down button** of your iPhone simultaneously for about 2 seconds. This will disable biometric identification and require your passcode to access the phone. Alternatively, 5 quick presses of the side button achieves the same result. For maximum security, power off your phone entirely, as iPhones are fully encrypted before the first unlock (BFU). After the first unlock (AFU), data is less secure. Note that biometric unlock also requires the passcode after a restart.
* How to correctly use eyebrow razors?
	1. 45-degree angle
	2. gentle/short/downward strokes in the direction of hair growth
* 眼鏡布 → 擦眼鏡鏡片 (X) 擦手機螢幕 (O)
* Attach water-saving tap aerator to toilet/kitchen faucets
* Do a passive wardrobe audit: “At the start of the year, turn all your hangers the wrong way round. By the end of the year, if anything still isn’t facing the right way, get rid of it: if you haven’t worn it for a year, you probably won’t.”
* Read 3-star or 6/10 reviews on Amazon, Google Maps, etc. → That’s where a review could be the best and most helpful.
* 自製果蠅誘捕器：在乾淨的玻璃罐中混合醋與糖，滴入少許洗碗精以破壞表面張力，再放入一小段香蕉增強誘餌香氣；用保鮮膜封口，並在上方戳幾個小洞，果蠅即可自由進入卻難以逃脫，實現“易入難出”效果。
* How to not forget your keys?
	1. Always put the keys first thing into the backpack/luggage if you plan to leave home at a later time
	2. Insert the keys into the door lock
	3. Put the keys on your shoes or under whatever you need to take with you leaving home
	4. Trick/Train yourself into not locking the door with the knob, but only with the keys
* 衣物車縫處脫線 → 打火機轉小火，點脫線處，弄熄，線頭就燒成小黑球 (= 打結)
* How to make a Post-it® note (N 次貼) lie flawlessly against a surface, without a giant air bubble? Instead of peeling sticky notes from the corner, rip sticky notes _from the side, right below where the sticky part ends._ Or: [pull flat and straight *from the bottom up.*](https://sketchplanations.com/peel-a-post-it)
* 讓下次可以快速取用膠帶的方法: (1) 摺一角 (2) 黏在桌邊
* Disable auto-play feature on Netflix, YouTube, etc. to prevent binge-watching
* 牙膏、洗面乳等用罄時，使用剪刀將軟管瓶身剪開，將可以再多使用 3-5 次！
* Break up effervescent tablets into half with your hand before adding to water. It dissolves quicker due to the increased surface area. Stirring it also quickens up the process.
* How to get maximum cooling in your home during summer?
	1. Identify the coolest part of your home. In the evening, find a window in a shaded area or on the lower floor where the air is cooler. If possible, use a thermometer to check which part of your home has the lowest temperature.
	2. Create cross-ventilation. Open windows on opposite sides of the house to encourage airflow. If you have multiple floors, open windows upstairs and downstairs to enhance the chimney effect.
	3. Wait for the right temperature. Once the outdoor temperature drops below the indoor temperature, it’s time to bring in cool air.
	4. Use a fan strategically. Place a powerful fan near the hottest window and direct it outward to push warm air out. This will draw in cooler air through the other windows.
	5. Seal the cool air inside. In the morning, before the outdoor temperature rises, close all windows and blinds to trap the cool air. Consider using blackout curtains to reduce heat gain throughout the day.
* Keep your eye drops in the fridge for the extra soothing and redness relief / to enhance the cooling sensation when applying for itchy/burning eyes.
* Avoid long exposure to direct sunlight for ANYTHING [^1]
* Waiting 30-60 seconds (by wiping the water off your body with your hands, or shaking off like a dog lol) to dry off before stepping out of the shower significantly decreases the volume of water soaked/absorbed by your towel, allowing it to stay drier for longer. [^2]
* Don’t buy CDs for people. They have Spotify. Buy them merch from a band they like instead. It’s more personal and the band gets more money.
* 洗碗精、洗手乳、沐浴乳、洗髮精等用罄時，把容器裝滿水稀釋，將可以再多使用 3-5 次！
* Always underpromise and overdeliver! For example, if you know how late you are going to be, add an extra 5-10 minutes to it. It might be annoying for the person/people when you say it initially, but when you come before the time you said, it will evoke a far more positive reaction than underestimating the lateness time.
* How to choose mouthwash/mouthrinse (Mundspülung)?
	1. Has fluoride (cavity prevention)
	2. No alcohol (dries your tissues out)
* DIY Air Conditioner
	1. Metal fan with ice blocks on the back, parallel to the direction of airflow
	2. Metal fan with wet towels hanging in the front (evaporative cooling)
* Best fan placement to move air through the house
	1. Blowing air out of the window, not into the room
	2. 1-1.5 meter from an open window
* Change your posture and stand upright each time you go through a door
* Getting married? Don’t just let friends and family know, tell companies too! Email a couple dozen companies that you had interest in, let them know of your upcoming celebration of getting married. They might email you back, and ask for your address to send free stuff, goodie/gift bags, etc.
* 吃冰棒的技巧: 「一邊從頂部小口咬，一邊從根部往上舔」(Why? 冰棒都是從最上端開始融化，這樣做可以讓往下滴的水量減到最少)
* You can search the photos on your iPhone by just typing in people, items, months, years, seasons, places you want to see, text in screenshots, etc.
* Play YouTube videos in VLC media player to skip ads. Plus, you also benefit from all the capabilities of VLC.
* Don’t look at your medical test reports before the doctor has a chance to explain them to you. Additionally, never ask the doctor what you should do. Instead, ask him what he would do if he were in your place. You would be surprised at the difference.
* Regularly open windows to remove CO2 and exchange for fresh air
* Invest in the things (1) you use for a significant portion of your life (2) between you and the Earth. These possessions are worth the investment. You will thank yourself later.
	1. bed – you spend a third of your life sleeping
	2. bedding – mattress, pillow, blanket, etc.
	3. walking/running shoes, boots – your feet carry you everywhere
	4. tires – they’re the only contact between your vehicle and the road
* 去麥當勞點餐時，和店員說要「不加鹽」的薯條，就可以得到熱騰騰、剛出爐的新鮮現炸薯條
* How to correctly use the 3 compartments in a washing machine tray/drawer?
	1. Slot I is for the pre-wash cycle followed by a main wash cycle if you have it on, but remember to fill Slot II every time as well
	2. It’s not recommended to put the detergent directly on top of the clothes because it may not disperse evenly or rinse out with lower water levels
* How to heal dry, cracked fingertips? Use Vaseline (or O’Keeffe’s Working Hands Hand Cream) before bed and put socks or (disposable, polyethylene PE, plastic, foodservice) gloves on hands for sleeping.

# 💡 On “Careers \& Work”

* When people hesitate to give you honest feedback, ask for a score from 0-10, instead of asking, “_What do you think?_”—which invites ambiguity. You’ll rarely get a perfect 10, and this makes it easy to follow up with, “_What would make this closer to a 10?_” Better questions lead to better feedback—and faster growth.
* Use an exercise ball or a kneeling chair, instead of an office chair with wheels at work, to maintain a better posture.
* [No matter how much your workplace pushes “team building” and “family culture” - remember, they're not your friends and it's still a workplace.](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/k3ywxq/lpt_no_matter_how_much_your_workplace_pushes_team)

# 💡 On “Home”

* [When assembling furniture, first tighten all screws to 75%, then fully secure them once all components fit together. This principle extends beyond furniture.](https://perell.com/note/28-pieces-of-life-advice/)
* [How to make pillows out of blankets?](https://www.reddit.com/r/lifehacks/s/PEescdRSx4)
* [10 Useful Hacks with Binder Clips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3czrTVSlGhY)
* **[Know The Difference!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NYotD8npmg)** A _toilet plunger_ has a \<u\>flange (a soft, narrow rubber sleeve)\</u\> that extends from the cup, designed to create a tight seal in the curved drain of a toilet. A _sink plunger_, on the other hand, has a flat cup suitable for creating a seal on flat surfaces like sinks or bathtubs.
* [How to Seal a Bag of Chips without a Clip](https://youtu.be/AdhUifjOahs)
* Replace Fabric Softener with White Vinegar
	1. Cheap
	2. Natural (more eco-friendly)
	3. Not only a clothing softener, but also a clothing deodorizer (especially good for towels!)
	4. Will remove hard water deposits in your washing machine as well
	5. DO NOT MIX VINEGAR AND CHLORINE BLEACH OR COLOR SAFE BLEACH EVER!!!! THEY WILL PRODUCE DANGEROUS CHEMICALS!
* What to do with used, air/oven-dried coffee grounds?
	1. Use them as deodorizer for stinky garbage bags
	2. Layer them at the bottom of biodegradable bins to absorb some liquid that seeps out of the food scraps/waste
* You can lower energy costs on freezers by keeping them full. (Why? Air is expensive to cool down. Water/ice has a very high heat capacity so it’s resistant to temperature changes.) Fill the empty space in your freezer with bottles of water to make large blocks of ice, which is useful for many occasions, such as power outages. Or ever better: filling it with empty containers that have only air in them → Empty bottles of air take much less energy to cool down initially (compared to empty bottles of water), and also keep the cold air from falling out when you open the door of the freezer.
* How to organize plastic bags?
	1. Flatten your bag, then fold it in half twice.
	2. Start from the hand-holding end and fold it in a triangular pattern, until you reach the end of your bag.
	3. Once you are at the end, tuck the end tab into the folds, and you have your bag in a small triangle.
* Store sheet sets by tucking them neatly inside one of the matching pillow cases. This keeps everything together and organized, making it easy to grab and use when needed!
* [How to Tie a Food Bag Properly?](https://www.reddit.com/r/lifehacks/comments/1hlosv9/the_proper_way_to_tie_a_food_bag/)
* Store canned goods like baked beans upside down, so the contents slide out easily without needing to scrape the bottom when you open the can.

# 💡 On “Email \& Phone/Video Call”

* Do not scan the inbox on Friday evening or over the weekend if you might encounter work problems that cannot be addressed properly until Monday.
* Do not e-mail first thing in the morning or last thing at night. The former scrambles your priorities and plans for the day, and the latter just gives you insomnia.
* [Make decisions easy for busy people. You will rise fast in your career if busy people like working with you. Here’s a tip: when you have a problem to solve, come prepared with a suggested next step. If you have a question, phrase it in a way they can answer yes/no. If there are multiple options, lay them out and ask them to pick one. Try to avoid expansive, open-ended questions.](https://perell.com/note/28-pieces-of-life-advice/) [^3]
* End your emails with “I totally understand if you’re too busy to reply, and thank you for reading this far,” instead of the usual “I look forward to your reply and speaking soon.”
* If you’re stuck on an annoying call, put your phone on airplane mode instead of just hanging up. The other person will see “call failed” instead of “call ended.”
* Turn off self-view on video calls. Underrated trick to actually focus on the people you’re talking to instead of spending most of the time concerned with how you look.
* [Never say yes on the phone/email to avoid commitments made under social pressure or the desire to please.](https://tim.blog/2023/09/28/shane-parrish-farnam-street/)
* Make phone calls as walking meetings in the sun.
* Whenever you are on a Zoom call, put your headphones or AirPods in, then open up YouTube, and find an ambient soundtrack that you play at 5% volume (e.g., [Lord of the Rings ambience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30b7_S0paCQ\&ab_channel=AmbientWorlds), [Harry Potter ambience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQdTu0IeVho\&ab_channel=AmbientWorlds), etc.). This way, as you are taking the call, there’s a soft, inspiring soundtrack playing in the background. The soundtrack makes anything anyone says feel more relaxed, more warm, and more energizing.
* [When asking for a favor over email, lead with the request and save the small talk for later. It feels much more sincere when the pleasantries come after the ask.](https://mariandrew.substack.com/p/100-things-i-know)

# 💡 On “Wellness \& Wellbeing”

* When in bed, meditate. Either you will have a deep relaxation, or fall asleep. It’s a win-win.
* When you’re busy, do “micro-meditation”:
	1. Accept things as they are.
	2. Stop wishing things were different.
	3. No need to label, describe, comment, judge, or attach/assign meaning to everything.
	4. According to Vipassana, _craving (wanting something to happen)_ and _aversion (not wanting something to happen)_ are the roots of human suffering.
* When anxiety hits, drink a glass of water slowly and focus on the sensation. It helps ground you, regulate your breathing, and refresh your mind.

# 💡 On “Grocery Shopping”

* Looking at the UNIT price on the shelf tags at the grocery store.
* Never do grocery shopping when you are hungry!
* Shop on the outer perimeter of the grocery store. This is (usually) where all the whole, unprocessed foods are. The aisles have most of the processed junk.
* Buy pre-cut, frozen fruits and vegetables as a convenient and affordable alternative to fresh ones. They often retain more nutrients since they are picked and frozen at their peak ripeness, making them a more nutrient-dense option.
* Clean out your fridge before heading to the grocery store. It helps you avoid “mystery Tupperware” surprises, frees up space, and gives you a clear view of what needs restocking.

# 💡 On “Buying Things”

* When buying things, time and money trade-off against each other.—If you’re low on money, take more time to find deals. If you’re low on time, stop looking for great deals and just buy things quickly online.
* When you want to find out about people’s opinions on a product, succeed the product name with “reddit”. You’ll get real people arguing, as compared to the Google SEO results.
* Whenever doing research before purchasing any consumer electronics, watch “Review After 1 Year” YouTube videos instead of “Unboxing” ones
* When it comes to buying things, there is good, fast, and cheap—You can pick 2 but not all three.
	1. Good + Cheap: There are places to trade time for quality while keeping costs down.
	2. Good + Fast: There are times when you have to pay through the nose because you need it done fast and good.
* The 48-Hour Rule (to avoid stupid impulse purchases that would have gathered dust and make you regret): Whenever you’d like to buy something in a store or putting something in your online shopping cart, take a pause of at least 48 hours. In most cases, your desire to make the purchase will be gone by the time the 48 hours are over—if you still want it, it’s a sign the purchase might be well worth it anyway, then go ahead to complete the order; if not, skip it. [^4]
* If you’re looking for your good X, you have bad Xs. Throw those out.

# 💡 On “Parenting”

* If you want your kids to listen when you have something important to say, speak very quietly. Yelling doesn’t work, but a whisper grabs their attention.

# 💡 On “Creating Luck”

* Always ask/negotiate for what you want. Many people are happy to help—if the request is direct and specific. But never expect people to say yes.
* At checkout you can just ask “Do you have any coupons I can apply to this?”
* [Don't be afraid to ask a question that may sound stupid or dumb, because 99% of the time everyone else is thinking of the same question and is too embarrassed/scared to ask it. The simplest questions are the last to be answered. “Shake the tree.” You never know what will fall out. It never hurts to ask.](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/ask-yourself-dumb-questions-and-answer-them/)
* Send one message a day to a person you admire because you never know when you’ll get a response back.

# 💡 On “Social Interaction”

* Whenever you think something nice about someone, let them know IMMEDIATELY. → Find the best in others. Compliment people more.
	* Many people have trouble thinking of themselves as smart, or pretty, or kind, unless told by someone else. You can help them out and make someone’s day.
	* Start with “[NAME], I’m super grateful for you, you know why?” And then
	throws them the most sincere, genuine compliment.
* When someone asks, “Do you want a boy or a girl?” avoid the cliché response, “As long as the baby’s healthy.” It can unintentionally dismiss the experiences of parents with children who face health challenges. A simple, lighthearted answer like “We’re hoping for a girl!” keeps things positive without being insensitive.
* Playing is the opposite of fighting. If you find yourself stuck in a circular argument, try suggesting a role reversal: “I’ll argue your point, and you argue mine.” Not only does this foster empathy, but it also injects humor and lightens the mood in a tense situation.
* When someone is going through hell, just saying “I’m with you” is the most powerful thing you can do — Advice, perspectives, or offers to help/fix issues are minimally impactful. — The notion that someone is with you is 10x more powerful.
* Swap out “I know” for “You’re right!”
* Always give a reason when asking someone for a favor—people are more willing to help when they understand why.
* 發表主觀意見時，可以在語末加上 “IMO” or “If that makes (any) sense.” or “Feel free to disagree with me.” or “Correct me if I’m wrong.”
* Avoid saying “but” when adding opinions to others’ ideas—use “and” instead. For example, say, “I like your suggestion, and exploring another option could also be helpful,” rather than, “I like your suggestion, but we should also explore another option.”
* [等一下 → 馬上來](https://sketchplanations.com/dont-think-of-an-elephant)
* Replace “Sorry” With “Thank You”: (1) Instead of saying “Sorry, I’m late.” Say: “Thank you for waiting.” (2) Instead of saying “Sorry, I forgot it.” Say: “Thank you for reminding me.”
* If you need to calm someone down and get them to communicate, ask them questions about numbers or personal information.
* When people mock you for not having an opinion on trending events, and label you as ignorant, start asking them about the current situation in Djibouti (吉布地，一個位於非洲東北部的國家) or Eswatini (史瓦帝尼，一個位於非洲南部的國家). It will reveal they aren’t up to date on the current situation in those countries - but that they also didn’t even know those countries existed. Peak ignorance. [^5]
* Instead of asking “Do you have any questions?”, try “What questions do you have?”
* How to increase engagement in discussions? Instead of “Anything else?”, ask “What else?”
* Add “Is everything fine for you?” after saying “How are you?”
* Whenever you are involved in a conversation with someone, respond with “Yes, and”, because it advances their idea.
* “What do you do?” → “What are you most excited about right now?”
* Master the “gift of goodbye.” Simply say goodbye without giving reasons. → Exit gracefully: “It was so great meeting you, I look forward to seeing you again soon!”
	* 天下無不散的筵席，離別是為了下一次更好的相遇/重逢
	* _[“Letting go means to come to the realization that some people are a part of your history, but not a part of your destiny.” — Steve Maraboli](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/525097-letting-go-means-to-come-to-the-realization-that-some)_
* A short, polite, timely rejection is much more valuable than a delayed, in-depth rejection.
* “What’s your favorite TY show/book/movie?” → “What’s the TV show you are into _recently_?”, “What’s the _last_ book you read?”, “What’s the movie you are _currently enjoying most_?” [^6]
* [It takes extreme strength and courage to be a consistently kind person in a world that rewards selfishness. Make sure to thank people who demonstrate kindness. They are choosing the hard, selfless route in order to make the world a better place for everyone.](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/1107h0s/lpt_it_takes_extreme_strength_and_courage_to_be_a)
* [Kids love absurd questions. If you want to connect with them, ask something totally grown-up—like “What kind of car do you drive?” or “So, what do you do for work?” They’ll crack up, and the more you continue the bit, the more they will loosen up with you.](https://mariandrew.substack.com/p/100-things-i-know)
* [The quickest way to alienate someone is to tell them they need to change. If you truly want to influence/castigate someone’s behavior, the most effective approach is to praise/compliment them when they do something you value — not to criticize them when they don’t.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyfUysrNaco\&t=1h33m3s) [^7]

# 💡 On “Emotion Control”

* Count to 10 in your head before responding to a strong emotion to avoid regret.
* Ever been in a heated argument or faced someone overly aggressive? Remember, the emptiest head rattles the loudest. Instead of matching their energy, do the opposite—soften your tone and lower your voice. A calm response can defuse tension and shift the dynamic in your favor.

# 💡 On “Cooking”

* [Chef Tip: How to peel and segment a grapefruit?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whkgVWWJijE)
	1. 用「手剝」（先用刀切對半) → 快
	2. 用「刀剝」 → 慢
		1. [You only cut the rind twice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_erG7HSK0A\&t=419s): (1) Start at stem, cut entirely. (2) Rotate a 90°angle to the first cut, but this time only cut deep enough to go through the rind 外皮，外殼; 硬皮 and pith [the white skin under the rind] 襯皮; 木髓 (吃起來會苦 bitter 的白色纖維), then peel around the core while unrolling the grapefriut.
		2. Once you peel away the whole rind, cut down one edge of the wedge, but stop at the middle and with your knifes edge, gently push up towards the other side of the wedge. This will peel the wedge from the inner pith. And repeat until all wedges are out.
* Egg Cracking: Instead of tapping the egg on the edge of a bowl several times (which creates multiple tiny fractures of egg shells), tap the egg on a flat surface such as the counter (firmly) only ONCE (which creates the cleanest split)
* [Adding a teaspoon of baking soda to your boiling pot of water will help to seamlessly remove the shell of hard-boiled eggs without peeling.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN2gYHJNT3Y) [^8]
* 如何避免「馬鈴薯」或「蘋果」削皮後「褐變」氧化變黑？
	1. 立刻將其浸泡於水中，避免與空氣接觸。也可以加入少許「鹽」或「醋」來延緩氧化，並將食材放置於「冷藏」中
	2. 將其加熱煮至半熟（約 5 分鐘），再切片或搗爛成泥後放入「冷凍」保存
* 冷凍法省時烤地瓜：先將地瓜放進冷凍庫不多不少 45 分鐘左右後，「直接」放進烤箱用 200 度烤 30 分鐘，可破壞地瓜細胞壁，加速熱傳導，節省至少一半以上的烘烤時間。這個做法烤出來的地瓜內部組織是綿密的，且依然有著用烤箱長時間烘烤才有的濃郁風味。

* Don’t throw out fruit that is going to bad, especially bananas gone brown. Instead, freeze it and make great smoothie!
* [Placing heavier, frozen items on top of lighter ingredients helps weigh them down and gets the blend moving faster. This can also help prevent the blend from stalling.](https://www.vitamix.com/us/en_us/learn)
* Grape Stemming Trick: Grab a dish towel, apply a little pressure \& some rolling, then you can remove all the grapes from the vine within seconds. No more plucking grapes one by one.
* When googling a recipe, precede it with “best.” You’ll find better recipes.
* How to cook perfectly shaped burger patties? Simply make a deep depression in the center of the beef patty before you cook it, using your thumb or another round, small object like the back of a measuring spoon or an ice cream scooper. Meat contracts while cooking, which is why a uniformly shaped beef patty will swell in the middle as it sits on the grill or pan. By utilizing this trick, the divot will start to disappear as the meat cooks.
* Put a wooden spoon across boiling pot of water to keep it from boiling over.
	1. Why? Wooden spoons, made primarily of cellulose, have a unique texture and fibrous structure that disrupts the surface tension of bubbles. When you place a wooden spoon over a pot of boiling liquid, any bubbles that touch it immediately burst. This action creates a small bubble-free area near the center of the pot, which allows other bubbles to move toward it and burst as well. Because these bubbles pop before they can rise to the edge of the pot, this cycle keeps the bubbling mass below the pot’s rim, effectively preventing boil-overs.

* Frozen (Greek) Yogurt (soft \& fluffy) = Healthy Ice Cream (crystalized)
	* 一小時攪拌一次，重複 3 遍，或是冷凍取出後於室溫中靜置 5 分鐘，會讓口感更綿密
	* Options for ingredients: milk, raisins, strawberries, etc.
* 蜂蜜不能用熱水沖泡 → 建議沖泡溫度低於 60℃，較能夠保留完整的營養價值
* Steeping minutes for a cup of good tea:
	* 3 mins for green tea
	* 4 mins for black tea
	* 5 mins for herbal tea
	(兌水比例約為 200–300 c.c.)
* Wash your fruits and veggies with white vinegar + baking soda solution
	1. Soak your fruits and veggies in 1 part distilled white vinegar + 3-4 parts filtered water for at least 10 mins — the vinegar’s acidity helps remove micro-organisms and some pesticides, but not all.
	2. Add baking soda (2 tsp) to form CO2 bubbles, which help push dirt out. Let it bubble for 2-5 minutes.
	3. Rinse with normal water.
	4. Drain and dry the fruits and veggies, prior to storing in a container in the refrigerator.
* 如何正確烹飪青菜，保留最完整的營養素？
	* 最推薦：「水炒法」—少油或無油
	* 最不推薦：「汆燙法」—若要採用此方法，應避免長時間烹調，快煮 30 秒至 1 分鐘後即撈起，可保留鮮綠色澤，並減少「水溶性維生素」流失，溶出的營養素可再利用，例如作為湯底或調製醬汁。適用於短時間內即可煮熟的青菜
	* 「清蒸法」：不會讓蔬菜直接接觸水，能更好地保留營養成分，不過，若蒸太久，會讓菜葉變得軟爛，外觀也會變黃，影響視覺效果。綠葉蔬菜不太適合使用此方法，因為它們容易失去爽脆口感，此方法較適用於根莖類或果實類蔬菜
	* 「微波法」：利用蔬菜自身所含的水分子在微波作用下摩擦產生熱量，從而快速加熱食物，因此沒有養分流失的問題。微波加熱的一大挑戰是熱量分布不均，導致食物表面已經熟透，但內部仍未完全熟透。為了避免這種情況，建議採用「漸進式加熱法」—若需要加熱 3 分鐘，可以先加熱 2 分鐘後取出，攪拌均勻，再繼續加熱 1 分鐘

# 💡 On “Body Care”

* How to deal with Body Odor?
	1. Use Exfoliating Gloves to very gently exfoliate skin on your armpits once a week
	2. Apply “The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution” all over your body (include armpits) after every shower before lotion
* Avoid getting hair ¹ or oral ² hygiene products on your face, as they can block pores and potentially trigger acne.
	1. 可以仰頭或低頭
	2. 先刷牙 + 洗頭，最後再洗臉
* Use a microfiber (超細纖維) bath towel, they’re about the same price and get you so much drier so much faster!
* 把「人工皮」當「痘痘貼」使用的好處
	1. 可以任意剪裁所需的尺寸大小
	2. 單位面積價格較便宜
	3. 較傳統痘痘貼厚，效果更好
* How to deal with Sweaty/Stinky Feet?
	1. Choose the right socks: Smartwool® Merino wool socks
	2. Avoid wearing the same pair of socks/shoes on 2 consecutive days. Air out your shoes outside.
	3. Wash your feet at least once, if not twice, a day, using antibacterial soaps. → Dry the feet thoroughly, especially in between the toes. → (1) Apply a light dusting of anti-fungal foot powder/cornstarch/baby powder before slipping on cotton socks and breathable shoes. (2) Use antiperspirant (止汗劑) after showering in the evening (better than in the morning). Repeat this for another 3 or 4 consecutive nights and then switch to using it once or twice a week.
	4. Soak your feet: add a few drops of an antibacterial solution (like sodium hypochloride, aka chlorox 次氯酸鈉/漂白水, or white vinegar) to a bucket/basin of warm water (+ epsom salt + tea tree/eucalyptus oil) → Pro Tip: do this while watching TV.
	5. Baking soda has excellent moisture-absorbing and deodorizing properties. Evenly sprinkle it inside the shoes and let it sit overnight to absorb moisture and odors. The next day, shake out the powder. Doing this once a week can effectively reduce unpleasant smells inside the shoes.

# 💡 On “House Cleaning”

* [How to clean a microwave with white vinegar?](https://www.ovenclean.com/blog/how-to-clean-a-microwave-with-white-vinegar)
	1. In a microwave-safe bowl or jug, mix 500ml of water with 2 tablespoons of white vinegar.
	2. Place the bowl in the microwave and heat on full power for 5 minutes, until the liquid starts boiling.
	3. Leave the microwave door closed for 3 minutes to trap the steam, which will loosen grime.
	4. Carefully open the door, using an oven mitt/glove to remove the hot bowl.
	5. Use a sponge or towel to wipe down the microwave’s interior, starting from the top and moving down to the sides and door. For tough spots, scrub gently as needed.
	6. Wipe the turntable with the sponge/towel, then dry it with a clean cloth. Your microwave is now clean!
	7. (Optional) Use any leftover white vinegar to remove grease from the _hob_, _work surfaces_, and _cupboards_—white vinegar is a powerful degreaser, _especially when warm_. It’s also versatile for cleaning carpets, clearing drains, washing windows, freshening bathrooms, and more!
* How to effectively clean the vacuum cleaner bin (to remove dust, hair, etc.)?
	1. Gently scrub the motor/electric parts (e.g., cyclone) with a soft tooth and/or bottle brush
	2. Soak all the non-motor/electric parts (e.g., filter) in warm soapy water (with vinegar) for a few hours
	3. Allow them to air dry for at least 48 hours (and NEVER use the vacuum cleaner before they are completely dry, to avoid the terrible moldy smell!)
	4. (Optional) Add some _dried_ lavender or eucalyptus (or simply newspapers) from time to time to keep it smelling nice
* Use [luffa or loofah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luffa) as dish cleaning sponges.
	1. They dry out more quickly than synthetic sponges. Faster drying reduces the likelihood of bacteria and mold growth, making them more hygienic—and don’t get smelly.
	2. Their natural fibrous texture provides excellent scrubbing power without being overly abrasive, effectively removing dirt and residue while being gentle enough to protect surfaces from scratches.
	3. They are durable and can last for several weeks or months. When they wear out, they can be composted instead of thrown away.
	4. They are eco-friendly (biodegradable and compostable), unlike synthetic sponges, which contribute to plastic pollution and take decades to break down.
	5. Added Benefit: You can even use them to clean and exfoliate your body skin during showers!

# 💡 On “Traveling”

* When travelling with airplanes, order four double Gin Tonic (琴通寧) as soon as the flight attendants are walking about. Consume swiftly, and fall asleep for the remainder of the flight.
* In a hotel, use the pants hangers with clips to keep the curtains/drapes all the way closed during the night.
* [The Hotel Towel Drying Trick: After washing your clothes in the sink or shower, lay them flat on a clean towel. Roll the towel up tightly with the clothes inside, creating layers. Then wring the whole roll—this pulls out a surprising amount of water. Unroll, hang your clothes up, and let them air dry overnight. If it’s still damp in the morning, use the hotel hair dryer to finish it off quickly.](https://sketchplanations.com/hotel-drying-technique)
* Skip the boarding line and board the plane last. Ignoring your assigned group is perfectly okay—as long as you have a seat, you’re not missing anything. You’ll avoid the crowded jetway, reduce the time you spend stuck in your seat, and have an easier time navigating the aisle without a line of people behind you. Plus, it gives you a chance to stretch and relax a little longer before the flight.
* [Wearing the travel pillow with the bulk of the cushion at the front (i.e., positioning the snap enclosure at the back) provides better support for the chin, lower jaw, neck, and head, enhancing overall comfort.](https://www.tiktok.com/@sidneyraz/video/6982254638443531525)
* [Coming back from a trip can feel like you’ve aged a century. Before you head out, tuck a bottle of sparkling water in the fridge and stash a frozen pizza in the freezer—your future, travel-weary self will be deeply touched by your foresight.](https://mariandrew.substack.com/p/100-things-i-know)
* [Learn some geography—it makes travel conversations so much richer when you know where different countries are located (and as a bonus, which languages are spoken there!). Understanding the geography and languages of places like Africa, Eastern Europe, and India has completely transformed my interactions—people really light up when you show you understand where they’re from.

# 💡 On “Fitness”

* Whenever you sit, make sure your butt flush with the backrest to avoid back pain
* Whenever brushing your teeth:
	1. Use your non-dominant hand (Side Note: Regular use of your non-dominant hand for activities like scrolling, brushing teeth, opening doors, etc. can help improve overall dexterity and coordination)
	2. Balance on one leg in the morning and the other leg in the evening (例如: 早上用左手刷牙\&右腳站立，早上用右手刷牙\&左腳站立)
	3. Do (single-leg) squats (on a balance board)
* Get a small trampoline. It’s fun to bounce on \& activates your lymphatic system to rid your body of toxins.

# 💡 On “Saving Money”

* [Save money on city hotels. You’re away from the room for most of the time. If you need to meet at a nice hotel for dinner, stay down the street and make a reservation. Spend the money you save on beach hotels, especially if you plan to spend entire days there.](https://perell.com/note/28-pieces-of-life-advice/)
* If you bus to other cities, consider finding a car/ride-share instead. It’s cheaper, faster, and leads to interesting conversations.
* Free Filtered Water at Hotels: Instead of purchasing water bottles from your hotel room minibar, bring a reusable water bottle and fill it up at the fitness center. Nearly all hotels provide filtered water in the fitness center.

# 💡 On “Dressing”

* How to make use of the extra holes (aka The Runner’s Knot 跑者洞) on your running shoes? [The Heel Lock Lacing Method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBbc6TackDQ\&t=68s)
	1. This gives you a better lockdown around the ankle, so it avoids putting too much pressure on the top of you foot and minimizes the heel slippage.
	2. That’s the reason why runner laces are often so long.
